The program View5D interactively displays of up to 5 dimensional volumetric datasets.

Multi-dimensional data frequently arises in confocal microscopy and medical imaging applications. The applet can be tested by clicking the links below, however a Java runtime environment (preferably from Sun Microsystems) must have been installed and Java activated in the preferences of your browser!

Here are some [example screen shots](examples/index.html) and the applet version can be [tested](examples/index.html#Testing) or the [interactive online tutorials](View5DOnlineTutorials.html) can be used.  
There is also a [reference of all commands](View5DCommandReference.html) and mode of operation
