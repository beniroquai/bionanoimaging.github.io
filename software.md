We develop a couple of packages regarding microscopy data processing.
Many of our packages are mentioned on [GitHub](https://github.com/bionanoimaging).

## Python
* [NanoImagingPack](https://gitlab.com/bionanoimaging/nanoimagingpack) A python package for quantitative image analysis and intended to provide similar functionality as DIPimage in Matlab.

## JuliaLang
* [DeconvOptim.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/DeconvOptim.jl) for high-performance deconvolution on CPU and CUDA
* [FourierTools.jl](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/FourierTools.jl/) for working efficiently in Fourier space
* [PointSpreadFunctions.jl](https://github.com/RainerHeintzmann/PointSpreadFunctions.jl/) for calculating PSFs
* [View5D.jl](https://github.com/RainerHeintzmann/View5D.jl) for viewing high-dimensional data in Julia

## Java
* [View5D](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/View5D)
